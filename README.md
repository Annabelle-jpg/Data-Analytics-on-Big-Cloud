Entity Relationship Prediction â€“ Course Top 1, Final Grade A+ | Team Leader, Hong Kong
* NLP Pipeline Development: Led a team to build an end-to-end cloud NLP workflow on Databricks (PySpark) to predict entity relationships from noisy text. Orchestrated data cleansing, weak labeling, and model training/inference with distributed preprocessing and experiment tracking. Delivered 92% test accuracy with a fine-tuned BERT baseline and 85% with an LSTM benchmark, validating robustness via cross-validation and ablation.
* Graph Analysis: Addressed relation consistency and coverage gaps by constructing inter-entity graphs from model outputs. Implemented NetworkX routines for graph features (centrality, community) and path-based inference to refine edge predictions. Achieved 83% test accuracy on graph-driven classification and surfaced high-impact entities for error analysis and model iteration.
